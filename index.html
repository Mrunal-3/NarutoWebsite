        <p>Although there are variations from village to village, the general organisational structure and hierarchy of the ninja systems of each village is about the same. At the top of the organisation is the village head, or the Kage in the case of the Five Great Shinobi Countries. They rule the village and its shinobi together with a council, usually consisting of highly ranked shinobi and elders.
        The actual shinobi forces are divided in three groups. The regular forces, the Anbu, and the medical teams.!!</p>

          <h2>CHILDHOOD</h2>
          <p>Growing up as an orphan who suffered years of hatred and social isolation has influenced Naruto's character in a number of ways: he is heedless to formality and social standings, addressing certain people with nicknames instead of honourifics, although by the time of his adulthood, Naruto has slightly outgrown this trait.</p>

          <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
          <p>Naruto is noted as boisterous, exuberant, and unorthodox, quite similar to Hashirama Senju. He inherited his mother's verbal tic, as he ends his sentences with "Dattebayo!" (だってばよ!) when emotional. Though he responds best to competition and is not afraid to ask for assistance, Naruto is relatively naïve and slow to understand principles or situations. He often requires an oversimplified analogy in order to grasp explanations and can even prove forgetful. Naruto is aware of his faults and admits he acts strong to mask his embarrassment and frustration about them. Despite his naivety, Naruto can be quite observant, picking up on things others miss and retaining information casually gathered through conversation.</p>

          <h2>CHAKRA AND PHYSICAL POWER</h2>
          <p>As an Uzumaki and a reincarnation of Asura Ōtsutsuki, Naruto has massive reserves of strong chakra. Even as a child, he had at least four times the amount of a seasoned Jōnin like Kakashi Hatake, and described by Karin as "bright and warm".</p>

          <h2>HINATA</h2>
          <p>On the day of his enrolment in the Ninja Academy. Naruto first met Hinata Hyūga, who was being picked on by three bullies. Despite not knowing her, Naruto immediately came to her defence, but he was outnumbered and knocked unconscious, and the bullies damaged his red scarf. When Naruto awoke, Hinata thanked him for helping her and returned his scarf to him, but he let her keep it. He was unaware that the girl's growing affection for him began at that moment.</p>

            <h2>Recommended!!</h2>
            <p>To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better.
            The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and ...</p>

            <h2>Recommended!!</h2>
            <p>I began to browse through the reviews of Naruto, and realized something was horribly wrong. All the experienced anime watchers were giving it crappy reviews, and all the first-timers were giving it rave reviews, with reasons that every anime has to back them up. How could this be? Gee, I wonder. For some strange reason, Naruto has become the most popular and well-known anime series ever, and as such, it is usually the first anime seen by anime watchers alike. Why this is, I don't know. Maybe it appeals to a wide variety of young teenagers...
            When I was 13 years old, I remember watching and ...</p>

            <h2>Recommended!!</h2>
            <p>Naruto, yes Naruto. One of the series that has defined the cultural shonens of the last generation in the history of anime. This is a series that has changed significantly over the past decade.
            What I love bout naruto is the whole “Ninja aspect” of the show. Every technique had substance, quality and all of the training arcs really shown the defining elements of how ninjutsu worked within the naruto universe. 
            These qualities are something I will soon not forget. I know alot of people complain about naruto being a half ass wit that cant do nothing Or perhaps sakura being useless. But in away ...</p>

            <p>I'm sure most, if not all, the people who end up reading this review have seen Naruto before and those who haven't are
            probably put off by the pure unadulterated hatred this and the more recent Shippuuden garner. Okay, I guess "unadulterated"

            <h2>Recommended!!</h2>
            <p>I've heard a lot of people call this the most overrated anime of all time. So is it really? Well, that depends on who you ask. 
            Me? I'm one of the guys who loves it. This is the anime that got me into anime in the first place. So why should you read my review as opposed to the hundred others? 
            Because I'll try to show you both what everyone gripes about and what they love about the show. Bear with me on this review, as it will be a little long, 
            but since the anime I'm reviewing is pretty long, I have a lot to cover.

        <h2>Anime Names</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Anime: Black Clover</b><br>
            Both are Action Shonen that are made by the same studio. 
            Both are about a young boy who wear a headband that is a Orphan that has Demon living inside of him, 
            both main characters have a similar personality and same dream to became the Wizard King/Hokage. 
            The different between the two is Black Clover is more of a comedy and Naruto is more of a Drama, 
            Black Clover also does a way better job with it's Female characters than Naruto. 
        <br><br>
            <b>Anime: One Piece </b><br>
            Both are great shounen series with "fight for nakamas" plot, and goals characters have made their mind to accomplish. 
            Also it looks like naruto somewhat resembles Luffy. If you enjoyed Naruto, I'm sure you will find One Piece amazing. 
        <br><br>
            <b>Anime: Hunter x Hunter</b> <br>
            Both series are long running (lots of episodes) series that center around action and fighting. The main characters are very good 
            and the stories are very profound. The powers of the different characters will surprise you every time you get to see a new one. 
            The main characters power never seem repetative and you will always want to see the next episode right away due the high level of 
            suspense throughout the series.
